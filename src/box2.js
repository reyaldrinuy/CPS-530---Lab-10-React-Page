        <h1>Problems Encountered</h1>
        <p>For the most part, I had little trouble creating the webpage. The main problem I had was setting up the environment. <br></br><br></br>
        I had little experience using the Windows terminal to create program files, as most programs I had created allowed me to make the file normally
        through File Explorer, text editor or an IDE. On the terminal, I ran 'npx create-react-app my-app' and 'npm start'. <br></br><br></br>
        I heavily relied on following a YouTube video to set up my environment/folder, javascript files, and for understanding how each
        function works. A specific problem that I had was concerning capitalization for function names. In the beginning, I named each function without capitalizing
        the first letter, which I later found out was incorrect syntax. It took around 20 minutes for me to solve the problem.<br></br><br></br>
        Other than that, designing the wbepage itself wasn't complicated as my skills designing a webpage improved throughout all the labs.
